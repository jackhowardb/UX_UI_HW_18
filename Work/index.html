          <p>The approach I take when working in UX  process is based on empathy to find the best solution for the stakeholders and the user. The User Persona is a way to start the process after interviewing and obtaining useful insights from userâ€™s pain points and needs.

        <div class="mb-4 text-grey-darker text-sm flex-1">
          <p>In this research project, I performed 2 one to one interviews and competitive analysis that obtained valuable insights. These insights included that most users would like a provider near them near their network and if they could not find one they considered going to an emergency room.  The analysis found few applications gave the option for users to pay ahead of time to save time in seeing a provider and increase accessibility.</p>

          <p>AccessCare can vastly decrease wait times as well as anxiety and frustration. The user as well as the one who takes care of someone may benefit from this application. In our ideation process most ideas pointed in that direction.

          <p>In our usability testing and analysis found most valuable iterations were to make scan credit card for appointment to be an option. There was  confusion in the use of application with onboarding so we added the value proposition under the name of the application. </p>

        <div class="mb-4 text-grey-darker text-sm flex-1">
          <p>The mobile application AccessCare can not only find the nearest provider that is in-network but the user can pay for their visit prior to the visit to expedite ideal patient care. </p>

        <div class="mb-4 text-grey-darker text-sm flex-1">
          
          <p>The challenges our team had was finding a way to look for a provider that was more innovative than current mobile applications on the market. We overcame that with a rigorous competitive analysis. Further insights from research include features that will be valuable to the user as well as the provider.
